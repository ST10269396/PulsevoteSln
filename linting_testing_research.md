# Linting and Unit Testing Research Summary

## What is linting?
Linting is the process of analyzing source code to identify potential errors, stylistic inconsistencies, and deviations from coding standards. It acts as an automated code review tool that catches issues before they reach production, improving code quality and maintainability.

## What are unit tests?
Unit tests are automated tests that verify individual components or functions work correctly in isolation. They test specific pieces of code with known inputs and expected outputs, ensuring each unit behaves as intended and helping catch regressions when code changes.

## Why are they critical for code?
Linting and unit testing are critical because they catch bugs early, enforce coding standards, improve code maintainability, and provide confidence when making changes. They reduce debugging time, prevent production issues, and make codebases more reliable and easier to work with for teams.

## Can these be automated in any way?
Yes, both linting and unit testing can be fully automated through CI/CD pipelines, pre-commit hooks, and IDE integrations. Automated pipelines run these checks on every code change, ensuring consistent quality and preventing broken code from being merged into main branches.

## How do you perform linting in a Node.js API?
In Node.js APIs, linting is typically done using ESLint with configuration files that define rules for code style, potential errors, and best practices. You run linting via command line (`npx eslint .`) or integrate it into build processes and IDEs for real-time feedback.

## How do you perform unit testing in a Node.js API?
Node.js APIs use testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha with assertion libraries. Tests are written in separate `.test.js` files that import modules, call functions with test data, and verify expected outcomes using assertions. Tests run via `npm test` and can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

## What problems can flaky tests bring to our lives?
Flaky tests create false positives, erode team confidence in the test suite, waste developer time investigating non-issues, and can lead to ignoring real failures. They make CI/CD pipelines unreliable, slow down development cycles, and ultimately reduce the effectiveness of automated testing strategies.

## Summary
Linting and unit testing are essential tools for maintaining code quality and reliability in Node.js APIs. Linting catches style issues and potential errors early, while unit tests verify individual components work correctly. Both can be automated through CI/CD pipelines, providing continuous quality assurance. However, flaky tests can undermine confidence in the testing process, so maintaining stable, reliable tests is crucial for effective development workflows.
