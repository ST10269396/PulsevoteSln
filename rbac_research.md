# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Research Summary

## What is RBAC?
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that restricts system access based on users' roles within an organization. Each role is associated with specific permissions, allowing users to perform only the actions pertinent to their responsibilities. This approach simplifies permission management by grouping access rights into roles rather than assigning them individually.

## Why is RBAC important in web applications?
Implementing RBAC in web applications is crucial for maintaining security and operational efficiency. It ensures that users can access only the resources necessary for their tasks, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions and potential data breaches. By aligning access controls with organizational structures, RBAC facilitates easier management and auditing of user permissions.

## How could different user roles affect access in PulseVote?
In PulseVote, different user roles would dictate varying levels of access:
- **Admin**: Full control over the system, including user management, organization creation, and poll oversight
- **Manager**: Ability to create and manage organizations, generate join codes, and oversee polls within their organizations  
- **User**: Capability to join organizations via codes, participate in polls, and view poll results

## What could go wrong if RBAC is not implemented correctly?
If RBAC is not implemented correctly, several issues could arise:
- **Unauthorized Access**: Users might gain access to sensitive information or functionalities beyond their role, leading to data breaches or system misuse
- **Operational Disruptions**: Improper access controls can result in accidental or malicious actions that disrupt normal operations
- **Compliance Violations**: Failure to enforce appropriate access controls may lead to non-compliance with industry regulations and standards

## Real-world example of RBAC failure
A real-world example highlighting the consequences of inadequate RBAC is the 2013 Target data breach. Attackers exploited insufficient access controls to gain access to sensitive customer data, resulting in the compromise of millions of credit and debit card accounts. This incident underscores the importance of implementing robust RBAC systems to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.

## Summary
RBAC is essential for securing web applications by ensuring users have appropriate access based on their roles. Proper implementation in PulseVote will delineate clear access boundaries for admins, managers, and users, safeguarding the system's integrity and user data. Neglecting correct RBAC implementation can lead to unauthorized access, operational issues, and compliance failures, as evidenced by real-world security breaches.
